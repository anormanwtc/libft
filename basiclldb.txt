compile (gcc etc -g) the etc must contain the .c files you want to look inside
lldb a.out
b functionname			breakpoint to stop at the first line of that function
r						run
n						next line
c						next breakpoint
p variablename			prints the variable, can be cast (char)num etc
q						quit

To cast int *array like int array[len] so that it prints the whole thing
p *(int(*)[len])array

lldb auto stops at the line causing segfaults and similar.
