Using LLDB to go through your code line by line to see when it behaves unexpectedly
Using this to find the where helps to find the why. Very useful debugging.

Method:

compile (gcc etc -g) the etc must contain the .c files you want to look inside

lldb a.out (variables)					variables can be given either place
b functionname			breakpoint to stop at the first line of that function
r (variables)			run, 			variables can be given either place
n						next line
c						next breakpoint
p variablename			prints the variable, can be cast (char)num etc
q						quit

To cast int *array like int array[len] so that it prints the whole thing
p *(int(*)[len])array

lldb auto stops at the line causing segfaults and similar.

if you want to pipe something:
settings set target.input-path ../File/Path/etc
