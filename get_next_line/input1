a

set of super small lines above in file1. This line will go long long long to check long long long lines. more etc 0987654321234567890 stuff stuff typing same line more same line still same line.........:"[]{}\|/?.>,<~!@#$%^&*()_-+= do all the characters work? Maybe? possibly that ?unicode? ยง will break? What else is to test? invalid fds, check (youll see later), null string passed, check. BUFF_SIZE 0, 1, 2, 12, 9999, 10mil check. (that you will have to DIY cause no changing #defines mid code) This is still the same line. All im expecting is a touch of slowness on this line for small buffers. A buffsize that would be just big enough to read once per line (ie just over agv line len) is what Im expecting will run best. Currently that looks to be around BUFF 70. Still same line...
